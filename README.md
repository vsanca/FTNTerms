### Simple battleship game | C, NCurses

Small project in my freshman year. Exploring game programming and design in C, using NCurses as frontend. 

This is a simple game based on Battleships, with an student exams and terms tematic.

Benchmarks have been done to test the rather simple AI and different difficulty settings.

#### Note: no modifications have been made since the conception of this project, this is a rather naive and clearly begginer project from the year of 2014.
