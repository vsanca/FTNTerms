### Simple battleship game | C, NCurses

Small project in my freshman year. Exploring game programming and design in C, using NCurses as frontend. 

This is a simple game based on Battleships, with an student exams and terms tematic.

Benchmarks have been done to test the rather simple AI and different difficulty settings.
